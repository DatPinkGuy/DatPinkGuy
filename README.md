### Hello There
I am a graduate in BSc Games Design and Development, and have high hopes in pursuing Game Development even further.</br>
Throughout the years in University, I got to enjoy coding and developing a variety of systems and mechanics in my projects.</br>

Most of my projects have been done using Unity Game Engine and C# language.
Currently working as an Intern Programmer for Aqua BluGames, where i get to experience Unreal Engine 5, C++ and Blueprints.
