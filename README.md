### Hello There Traveller
I am a graduate in BSc Games Design and Development, and have high hopes in pursuing Game Development even further.</br>
Throughout the years in University, I got to enjoy coding and developing a variety of systems and mechanics in my projects.</br>
You can see some of my current bigger projects by following links bellow:</br>
1.[Environment Mapping VR AR](https://github.com/DatPinkGuy/EnvironmentMapping)</br>
2.[VR Interactions](https://github.com/DatPinkGuy/VR_Interactions)</br>
3.[Room Modelling VR](https://github.com/DatPinkGuy/Emergent_Tech)</br>
Or you can check **Repositories** for even more.

Currently working on projects to increase my knowledge and expertise in C# and Virtual Reality side of development.</br>
But if chance arises, one of my goals is to also learn C++.</br>
